# Immutable X Cairo Contracts

[`Building on StarkNet`](#building-on-starknet) is a beginner-friendly tutorial to help kick-start development of your StarkNet project.

If you wish to contribute to the repository, check out [`Contribution`](#contribution) for help with setting up the environment.

## Building on Starknet

Get started building your project on StarkNet! We will run through all the steps required to set up your development environment, import the Immutable X contracts into your first StarkNet contract, and compile and deploy.

### Setup

Set up your StarkNet project in a Python virtual environment:

```bash
# create a folder 'new-project' for your project
mkdir new-project
cd new-project

# setup and activate virtual environment
python3 -m venv env
source env/bin/activate
```

Using `nile`:

```bash
pip install cairo-nile
nile init
```

Using `npm`/`hardhat`:

```bash
npm init
npm i @shardlabs/starknet-hardhat-plugin
```

- Be sure to add the following line to the top of your `hardhat.config.ts` or `hardhat.config.js`:

```javascript
import "@shardlabs/starknet-hardhat-plugin";
// or
require("@shardlabs/starknet-hardhat-plugin");
```

### Install library

To install the Immutable X contracts via `pip`:

```bash
pip install immutablex-starknet
```

### Using a preset

In this example, we will deploy a basic ERC20 token contract using our `ERC20_Mintable_Capped` preset. This ERC20 features Ownable, Mintable, and Capped functionality, and can be used for a variety of use cases, such as a simple governance token.

Create a new file in the `contracts` folder called `MyERC20.cairo`. We import the `ERC20_Mintable_Capped` preset to use out-of-the-box, which includes all the required functions for your basic ERC20 token.

```
# contracts/MyERC20.cairo

%lang starknet

from immutablex.starknet.token.erc20.presets.ERC20_Mintable_Capped import constructor
```

You can add additional functions to your contract as required, as long the function name does not conflict with the existing ERC20 functions.

**Note**: With the current contract extensibility pattern on StarkNet, you cannot override functions as you would in Solidity. To modify ERC20 functions from the preset it is recommended to copy-paste the Cairo code from the preset and change as required.

### Compile contracts

Using `nile`:

```bash
nile compile
```

Using `hardhat`:

- Specify the location of any imported files with the `--cairo-path` flag, for example with python3.9 and a virtual environment named `env`:

```bash
npx hardhat starknet-compile --cairo-path 'env/lib/python3.9/site-packages'
```

### Deploy

When deploying contracts with constructor arguments, note that Cairo short strings (name and symbol) and addresses (owner) are passed as felts. Uint256 objects (cap) consist of two felts, so they would be represented as two separate inputs (low and high) in the input arguments.

These utility functions from [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/cairo-contracts/blob/main/tests/utils.py) may be helpful in converting inputs into felts when interacting with Cairo contracts in the CLI:

```python
def str_to_felt(text):
    b_text = bytes(text, "ascii")
    return int.from_bytes(b_text, "big")

def to_uint(a):
    """Takes in value, returns uint256-ish tuple."""
    return (a & ((1 << 128) - 1), a >> 128)
```

Using `nile`:

```bash
nile deploy MyERC20 <name> <symbol> <decimals> <owner> <cap>
```

Using `hardhat`:

- Specify the network to deploy to with the `--starknet-network` flag (`alpha` is available by default and represents StarkNet's Alpha Testnet on Goerli):

```bash
npx hardhat starknet-deploy --starknet-network alpha --inputs "<name> <symbol> <decimals> <owner> <cap>"
```

# Contribution

If you wish to contribute to this repository, please check out our [contribution guidelines](../../CONTRIBUTING.md). To set up the development environment:

## Using Protostar

Protostar is a much more lightweight development environment that is easy to set up and use with minimal effort. Protostar can be used to run unit/functional tests and offers additional functionality through the CLI. See [Protostar documentation here](https://docs.swmansion.com/protostar/docs/tutorials/introduction). No Python virtual environment is required.

### Install Protostar

Copy and run in a terminal the following command:

```
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/software-mansion/protostar/master/install.sh | bash
```

You may have to restart the terminal. Run `protostar -v` to check Protostar and cairo-lang version.

### Install dependencies

Run the following command to install dependencies. Protostar currently uses git submodules to handle dependencies.

```
protostar install
```

### Run tests

```
# Run all tests
protostar test

# Run a specific test
protostar test ./path/to/test/file.cairo::test_name_here
```

## Using Hardhat

Hardhat setup will be required to run integration tests and hardhat tests on a local devnet. Hardhat also allows you to write and run scripts to deploy/interact with contracts in Typescript/Javascript.

If you run into issues, check the [troubleshooting](#Troubleshooting) section.

### Install Poetry

Extensive installation instruction can be found in the [`Official Poetry Documentation`](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/#installing-with-the-official-installer). 

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

### Prepare the Poetry environment

```bash
poetry install
```

And then to jump into the virtual environment for the project:

```bash
poetry shell
```

### Install npm packages

```
npm i
```

### Set up starknet-devnet

https://github.com/Shard-Labs/starknet-devnet

```
pip install starknet-devnet
```

If it is your first time setting up your Cairo environment, install `gmp`:

```bash
# ubuntu
sudo apt install -y libgmp3-dev

# mac
brew install gmp
```

Run with Docker:

```
docker pull shardlabs/starknet-devnet
```

Run docker container on localhost. Use the `--lite-mode` flag to skip transaction and block hash computation to slightly improve devnet performance:

```
docker run -it -p 127.0.0.1:5050:5050 shardlabs/starknet-devnet --lite-mode
```

Set up `hardhat.config.ts` to use devnet running on port 5050:

```
starknet: {
  venv: "active",
  network: "devnet", // alpha for goerli testnet, or any other network defined in networks
  ...
},
networks: {
  devnet: {
    url: "http://localhost:5050"
  }
},
```

### Compile contracts and run tests

Compile (example):

```
npm run compile
```

Run tests - make sure `starknet-devnet` is running if tests are to be run on devnet:

```
npm test [path-to-test]
```

# Troubleshooting Hardhat

## Potential issues with M1 Macs

## "gmp.h" not found

Instead of running plain `poetry install`, run:

```bash
CFLAGS=-I`brew --prefix gmp`/include LDFLAGS=-L`brew --prefix gmp`/lib poetry install
```

# Python

You may not have success with every version of Python. Version 3.8 should work out of the box.

To install, run:

```
brew install python@3.8
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip # on mac
```

Then add this to ~/.zshrc

```
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.8/bin:$PATH"
```

Some packages may not install properly when installing or compiling Cairo

Follow these instructions to fix this: https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/nile/issues/22#issuecomment-945179452

You may also run into issues with certain libraries. This is an example:

```

```

To resolve this, reinstall the package with:

```
python3 -m pip install LIBRARY_NAME -U
# e.g. frozendict is the broken library
python3 -m pip install frozendict -U
```
